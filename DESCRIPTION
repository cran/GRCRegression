Description: Implement maximum likelihood estimation for Poisson generalized
  linear models with grouped and right-censored count data. Intended to be used
  for analyzing grouped and right-censored data, which is widely applied in
  many branches of social sciences. The algorithm implemented is described
  in Fu et al., (2021) <doi:10.1111/rssa.12678>.
